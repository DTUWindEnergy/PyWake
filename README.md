# PyWake

This is a work-in-progress attempt to make something like FUSEDWAKE 2.0. Its relation to FUSEDWAKE is, however, not determined yet.
The idea is that it should:

- Reduce duplicated code
- Include wakemap functions
- Be faster
- Be suitable for layout optimization
- Support use of load surrrogate models
- Support complex terrain
- Support gradient based optimization
